# Treemap Diagram

## Overview

A treemap diagram built with D3.js.

## Description

This project utilized methods from the D3.js library that I hadn't ever worked with before, so it was a great learning opportunity. I haven't ever worked with data in a tree-like structure, and so it was very interesting for me to learn more about things like the .hierarchy() and .leaves() methods to map out the data in an informative way.

In addition, I learned about a couple concepts related to working with SVGs. One concept was understanding that I could use tspan elements to write each word within a given string on a new line. That was especially helpful for making sure that the names of each videogame don't get cut off in the data visualization. Another concept that I learned about was using the stroke and stroke-width properties in CSS to draw a border around each SVG rect element in the treemap diagram. This little styling adjustment makes the diagram much more aesthetically pleasing, and it makes it easier to see the actual size of each rect element (that way they don't all blend together in the same group).

Overall, this project was a great learning experience. Now that I have built five projects with D3.js, I am realizing that there are so many interesting ways to visualize data and the D3.js library has so many capabilities.
